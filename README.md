## Getting Started

Each lab is self-contained with its own documentation, source code, and build instructions. Navigate to the respective lab directory to get started.

### Prerequisites

- **For Lab 1:**
  - GCC compiler with C/C++ support
  - Xilinx Vitis HLS (for hardware synthesis)
  - Basic understanding of image processing

## Labs Overview

### Lab 1: Image Difference with Hardware Acceleration

Implements a posterized image difference algorithm with both baseline (software) and accelerated (FPGA) versions using Xilinx HLS.

**Key Concepts:**
- Pixel-wise absolute difference
- Three-level posterization
- Memory-mapped AXI interfaces
- Pipeline optimization for FPGA
